In the main.py app, there are registration and login options.
1. registration has a validation of username and mail.
2. login also has validation of username and password.
3. after registration, app goes to main manu
where user can register a new account or log in with newly registered credentials.
4. after successful authentication, app returns the unique user ID,
which i will use to filter existing diary entries or to create new one for that user only.

app is not finished yet :)
